# Project1
First App/Website practice build. 
This is currently not finished project I am working on that would be a model of a small bakery website for people to place orders for scones. 
It is looking to have a first page that shows what is for sale
A page for Cart, and a page for finalizing Orders. 
I am still working to add in Stripe A.P.I for finalizing the orders and go through their system. 
Right now the backend has been my primary focus and the styling and front-end work needs to be developed. 
I will continue to work on this project over the coming weeks to style it up and adjust its look. 
12-20-2022 is this readme added.
